Sales generated from engine programs, spare parts sales, and aftermarket business under these collaboration arrangements are recorded consistent with our revenue recognition policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts attributable to our collaborators for their share of sales are recorded as cost of sales in our Consolidated Financial Statements based upon the terms and nature of the arrangement. Costs associated with engine programs under collaborative arrangements are expensed as incurred. Under these arrangements, collaborators contribute their program share of engine parts, incur their own production costs and make certain payments for shared or joint program costs. The reimbursement from collaborators of their share of program costs is recorded as a reduction of the related expense item at that time.
