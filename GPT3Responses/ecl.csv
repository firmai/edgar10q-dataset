The ChampionX business was previously recorded in the Global Energy reportable segment and has been reported as discontinued operations. The goodwill that was previously assigned to the Global Energy reportable segment, which was also an operating segment and reporting unit, was reassigned to ChampionX and the Downstream operating segment, which both became separate reporting units during the first quarter of 2020, based on a relative fair value allocation. The Downstream operating segment is now aggregated into the Global Industrial reportable segment. In addition, the Company established the Global Healthcare & Life Sciences reportable segment during the first quarter of 2020 which is comprised of the Healthcare and Life Sciences operating segments, which were previously included in the Global Institutional and Global Industrial reportable segments, respectively. These were, and continue to be reporting units, therefore goodwill did not need to be reassigned as a result of the changes in segments. The Company also renamed the Global Institutional reportable segment to the Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment. Refer to Note 19 for further information.

(c)Represents purchase price allocation adjustments for acquisitions deemed preliminary as of the end of the prior year. ​Other Intangible Assets​The Nalco trade name is the Company's only indefinite life intangible asset. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company completed its annual impairment assessment of the Nalco trade name using the relief from royalty discounted cash flow method, which incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections, royalty rates and discount rates. Based on this testing, the estimated fair value of the Nalco trade name exceeded its carrying amount by a significant margin; therefore, no adjustment to the $1.2 billion carrying amount of the Nalco trade name was necessary. Additionally, no events during the second half of 2020 indicated a need to update the Company's conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2020. There has been no impairment of the Nalco trade name intangible asset since it was acquired.​The Company's intangible assets subject to amortization include customer relationships, trademarks, patents and other technology primarily acquired through business combinations. The fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations is estimated primarily using discounted cash flow methods at the time of acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated lives. The weighted average useful life of amortizable intangible assets was 14 years as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019.​The weighted average useful life by type of amortizable asset at December 31, 2020 is as follows:​(years)​​​Customer relationships 14Trademarks 14Patents 15Other technology 7​The straight line method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets subject to amortization each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimated remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of an intangible asset's remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset will be amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.
