48,"During the first quarter of 2020, MPLX identified an impairment trigger relating to asset groups within MPLX's Western Gathering and Processing (""G&P"") reporting unit as a result of significant changes to expected future cash flows for these asset groups resulting from the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic. The cash flows associated with these assets were significantly impacted by volume declines reflecting decreased forecasted producer customer production as a result of lower commodity prices. MPLX assessed each asset group within the Western G&P reporting unit for impairment. It was determined that the fair value of the East Texas G&P asset group's underlying assets were less than the carrying value. As a result, MPLX recorded impairment charges totaling $350 million related to its property, plant and equipment and intangibles, which are included in impairment expense on our consolidated statements of income. Fair value of property, plant and equipment was determined using a combination of an income and cost approach. The income approach utilized significant assumptions including management's best estimates of the expected future cash flows and the estimated useful life of the asset group. The cost approach utilized assumptions for the current replacement costs of similar assets adjusted for estimated depreciation and deterioration of the existing equipment and economic obsolescence. The fair value of the intangibles was determined based on applying the multi period excess earnings method, which is an income approach. Key assumptions included management's best estimates of the expected future cash flows from existing customers, customer attrition rates and the discount rate. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment analysis will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. The fair value measurements for the asset group fair values represent Level 3 measurements.",350,['Impairment of long lived assets held for use'],us-gaap_ImpairmentOfLongLivedAssetsHeldForUse,monetaryItemType,mpc,"As a result, MPLX recorded impairment charges totaling $350 million related to its property, plant and equipment and intangibles, which are included in impairment expense on our consolidated statements of income.",$350 million,MONEY,"As a result, MPLX recorded impairment charges totaling $350 million related to its property, plant and equipment and intangibles, which are included in impairment expense on our consolidated statements of income.","['consolidated statements of income', 'impairment charges', 'impairment expense', 'consolidated statements']","['impairment charges', 0.622673749923706, 'What is $350 million ?', 'impairment charges']",impairment charges,0.622673749923706,What is $350 million ?,impairment charges,Impairment charges
