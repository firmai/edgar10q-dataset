We design, develop, manufacture and sell high performance fully electric vehicles and design, manufacture, install and sell solar energy generation and energy storage products. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (""CODM""), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. As of and following December 31, 2020, there has continued to be widespread impact from the coronavirus disease (""COVID 19"") pandemic. In 2020, we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of the year. Some of our suppliers and partners also experienced temporary suspensions before resuming, including Panasonic, which manufactures battery cells for our products at our Gigafactory Nevada. We also instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our U.S. operations were scaled back. Finally, reduced operations or closures at motor vehicle departments, vehicle auction houses and municipal and utility company inspectors resulted in challenges in or postponements for our new vehicle deliveries, used vehicle sales, and energy product deployments. By the second half of 2020, however, we resumed operations at all of our manufacturing facilities and have continued to increase our output and add additional capacity and work with each of our suppliers and government agencies on meeting, ramping and sustaining our production. On the other hand, certain government regulations and shifting social behaviors have continued to limit or close non essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person to person interactions. In some cases, the relaxation of such trends has recently been followed by actual or contemplated returns to stringent restrictions on gatherings or commerce. We cannot predict the duration or direction of such trends, which have also adversely affected and may in the future affect our operations. On February 19, 2020, we completed a public offering of our common stock and issued a total of 15.2 million shares (as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, as described in the paragraph below), for total cash proceeds of $2.31 billion, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs of $28 million. On August 10, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a five for one split of the Company's common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend (the ""Stock Split""). Each stockholder of record on August 21, 2020 received a dividend of four additional shares of common stock for each then held share, distributed after close of trading on August 28, 2020. All share and per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the Stock Split. On September 1, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with certain sales agents to sell $5.00 billion in shares of our common stock from time to time through an ""at the market"" offering program.

With the exception of the Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option program discussed within the Automotive Leasing section below, we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with ASC 606 as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle's estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer's economic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. Due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during 2020, we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were provided prior to such adjustments. As a result, along with the estimated variable consideration related to normal future product returns for vehicles sold under the buyback options program, we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. If customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles, which resulted in a corresponding reduction in cost of automotive sales of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The net impact was $30 million reduction in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020. The total sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program was $703 million and $639 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, of which $202 million and $93 million was short term, respectively.

Automotive Leasing Revenue Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for Model S and Model X leases in certain regions, may opt to purchase the vehicles for a pre determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $752 million, $532 million and $393 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had deferred $293 million and $218 million, respectively, of lease related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option We offered buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the U.S. and where we expected the customer had a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception, we continued to recognize these transactions as operating leases. These transactions entailed a transfer of leases, which we had originated with an end customer, to our leasing partner. As control of the vehicles had not been transferred in accordance with ASC 606, these transactions were accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under this program, cash was received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value was generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment was recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. The option period expires at the earlier of the end of the contractual option period or the pay off of the initial loan. We capitalized vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheets, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Following the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases and there was no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows for new agreements are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. The end customer can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue. The maximum amount we could be required to pay under this program, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles, was $42 million and $214 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, including $23 million within a 12 month period from December 31, 2020.
