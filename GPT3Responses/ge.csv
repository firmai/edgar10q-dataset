Our Aviation business enters into collaborative arrangements and joint ventures with manufacturers and suppliers of components used to build and maintain certain engines. Under these arrangements, GE and its collaborative partners share in the risks and rewards of these programs through various revenue, cost and profit sharing payment structures. GE recognizes revenue and costs for these arrangements based on the scope of work GE is responsible for transferring to its customers. GE's payments to participants are primarily recorded as either cost of services sold ($1,221 million, $1,939 million and $1,809 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively) or as cost of goods sold ($2,279 million, $2,974 million and $3,097 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively). Our most significant collaborative arrangement is with Safran Aircraft engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France, which sells LEAP and CFM56 engines through CFM International, a jointly owned non consolidated company.
