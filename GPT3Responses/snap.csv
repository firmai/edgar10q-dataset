Under ASU 2020 06, the embedded conversion features are no longer separated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid in capital. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The new guidance also requires the if converted method to be applied for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020 06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the standard requires using either a modified retrospective or a full retrospective approach. Effective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020 06 using the modified retrospective approach. Adoption of the new standard resulted in a decrease to accumulated deficit of $95.0 million, a decrease to additional paid in capital of $664.0 million, and an increase to convertible senior notes, net of $569.0 million. Interest expense recognized in future periods will be reduced as a result of accounting for the convertible debt instrument as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020 01, Investments Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), which clarifies the interaction between the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321, the accounting for equity method investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options in Topic 815. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Effective January 1, 2021, we adopted this standard on a prospective basis. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019 12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as part of its Simplification Initiative to reduce the cost and complexity in accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019 12 removes certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. ASU 2019 12 also amends other aspects of the guidance to help simplify and promote consistent application of GAAP. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted ASU 2019 12 in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Adoption of the standard requires using either a modified retrospective or a full retrospective approach. Effective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020 06 using the modified retrospective approach. Adoption of the new standard resulted in a decrease to accumulated deficit of $95.0 million, a decrease to additional paid in capital of $664.0 million, and an increase to convertible senior notes, net of $569.0 million. Interest expense recognized in future periods will be reduced as a result of accounting for the convertible debt instrument as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020 01, Investments Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), which clarifies the interaction between the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321, the accounting for equity method investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options in Topic 815. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Effective January 1, 2021, we adopted this standard on a prospective basis. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019 12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as part of its Simplification Initiative to reduce the cost and complexity in accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019 12 removes certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. ASU 2019 12 also amends other aspects of the guidance to help simplify and promote consistent application of GAAP. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted ASU 2019 12 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The impact of adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems, was not material. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018 15, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other — Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350 40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018 15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs in a cloud computing arrangement service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred for an internal use software license.

48,"Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2020 06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470 20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815 40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity. Under ASU 2020 06, the embedded conversion features are no longer separated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid in capital. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The new guidance also requires the if converted method to be applied for all convertible instruments.
