Under the proportional amortization method, the investments are carried at amortized cost and amortized in proportion to the tax credits received. The amortization of the investments and the related tax impacts are recognized in income tax expense. Previously, we recognized the amortization of the investments in other noninterest income and the related tax impacts were recognized in income tax expense. We determined that the proportional amortization method is preferable because it better aligns the financial statement presentation with the economic impact of these investments, which generate tax credits over the lives of the investments.
