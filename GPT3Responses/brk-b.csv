2,"(f) Investments under the equity method We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and other investments when such investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock. In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. If net losses reduce our carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investee's book value.",20,['Equity method investment ownership percentage'],us-gaap_EquityMethodInvestmentOwnershipPercentage,percentItemType,brk-b,The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee.,more than 20%,PERCENT,The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee.,"['% of voting interests', 'voting interests of investee', 'significant influence', 'voting interests']","['voting interests', 0.5944005846977234, 'What is more than 20% ?', 'voting interests']",voting interests,0.5944005846977234,What is more than 20% ?,voting interests,significant influence
3,"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (h) Other receivables Other receivables include balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses recoverable, as well as other receivables. Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are primarily short term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatory government sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables relate to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from property and casualty contracts and benefits under life and health contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. Prior to 2020, we recorded provisions for uncollectible balances when it was probable counterparties or customers would be unable to pay all amounts due based on the contractual terms and historical loss history. Beginning in 2020, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement that affects the measurement of allowances for credit losses. In measuring credit loss allowances, we primarily utilize credit loss history, with adjustments to reflect current or expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate from historical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider right of offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge off receivables against the allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.",one year,"['Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables collection term']",brka_TradeReceivablesInsurancePremiumReceivablesAndOtherReceivablesCollectionTerm,durationItemType,brk-b,"Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are primarily short term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination.",less than one year,DATE,"Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are primarily short term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination.","['short term in nature', 'stated collection terms of year', 'stated collection terms from date', 'date of origination', 'Trade receivables', 'collection terms']","['stated collection terms from date', 0.8904566764831543, 'what is stated collection terms from date ?', 'less than one year']",stated collection terms from date,0.8904566764831543,what is stated collection terms from date ?,less than one year,collection terms
