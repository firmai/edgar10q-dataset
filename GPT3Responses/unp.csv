15,"1. Nature of Operations Operations and Segmentation-We are a Class I railroad operating in the U.S. Our network includes 32,313 route miles, connecting Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and Eastern U.S. gateways and providing several corridors to key Mexican and Canadian gateways. We own 26,069 miles and operate on the remainder pursuant to trackage rights or leases. We serve the western two thirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers for the handling of freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic is moved through Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders. The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although we provide and analyze revenue by commodity group, we treat the financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network. Our operating revenues are primarily derived from contracts with customers for the transportation of freight from origin to destination.

We recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for ""unrecognized tax benefits"" is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. Leases-We lease certain locomotives, freight cars, and other property for use in our rail operations. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments, discounted using our collateralized incremental borrowing rate, over the lease term at commencement date. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Operating leases are included in operating lease assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Finance leases are included in net properties, debt due within one year, and debt due after one year on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term and reported in equipment and other rents and financing lease expense is recorded as depreciation and interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We have lease agreements with lease and non lease components and we have elected to not separate lease and non lease components for all classes of underlying assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Leases with initial terms in excess of 12 months are recorded as operating or financing leases in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Pension and Postretirement Benefits-We incur certain employment related expenses associated with pensions and postretirement health benefits. In order to measure the expense associated with these benefits, we must make various assumptions including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return on plan assets used to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and expected future health care costs. The assumptions used by us are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability associated with these benefits. Personal Injury-The cost of injuries to employees and others on our property is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability. Our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value. Legal fees and incidental costs are expensed as incurred. Environmental-When environmental issues have been identified with respect to property currently or formerly owned, leased, or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we perform, with the assistance of our consultants, environmental assessments on such property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. Legal fees and incidental costs are expensed as incurred. Use of Estimates-The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported assets and liabilities, the disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.

Performance Retention Awards-In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved performance stock unit grants. The basic terms of these performance stock units are identical to those granted in February 2019, except for different annual return on invested capital (ROIC) performance targets. The plan also includes relative operating income growth (OIG) as a modifier compared to the companies included in the S&P 500 Industrials Index. We define ROIC as net operating profit adjusted for interest expense (including interest on average operating lease liabilities) and taxes on interest divided by average invested capital adjusted for average operating lease liabilities. The modifier can be up to +/ 25% of the award earned based on the ROIC achieved. Stock units awarded to selected employees under these grants are subject to continued employment for 37 months and the attainment of certain levels of ROIC, modified for the relative OIG. We expense the fair value of the units that are probable of being earned based on our forecasted ROIC over the 3 year performance period, and with respect to the third year of the plan, the relative OIG modifier. We measure the fair value of these performance stock units based upon the closing price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant. Dividend equivalents are accumulated during the service period and paid to participants only after the units are earned.
