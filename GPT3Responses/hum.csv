20,"Reinsurance and low income cost subsidies represent funding from CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program for which we assume no risk. Reinsurance subsidies represent funding from CMS for its portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the member's out of pocket threshold, or the catastrophic coverage level. Low income cost subsidies represent funding from CMS for all or a portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co payment amounts above the out of pocket threshold for low income beneficiaries. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. A reconciliation and related settlement of CMS's prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year. The Health Care Reform Law mandates consumer discounts of 50% on brand name prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. These discounts are funded by CMS and pharmaceutical manufacturers while we administer the application of these funds. We account for these subsidies and discounts as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity under receipts (withdrawals) from contract deposits in our consolidated statements of cash flows. For 2020, subsidy and discount payments of $13.3 billion exceeded reimbursements of $12.4 billion by $0.9 billion. For 2019, subsidy and discount payments of $11.8 billion exceeded reimbursements of $11.2 billion by $0.6 billion.
