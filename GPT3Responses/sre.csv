1,"As we discuss below in ""Off Balance Sheet Arrangements"" and in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Sempra Energy has guaranteed a maximum of $4.0 billion related to Cameron LNG JV's project financing and financing related agreements for the Phase 1 project. These guarantees terminate upon Cameron LNG JV achieving ""financial completion"" of the Phase 1 three train liquefaction export project, including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests, which are currently underway. Cameron LNG JV's financing agreements contain events of default customary for such financings, including a failure to achieve financial completion of the project by a deadline of September 30, 2021 (with up to an additional 365 days extension beyond such date permitted in cases of force majeure). Pursuant to the financing agreements, Cameron LNG JV is restricted from making distributions to its project owners, including Sempra LNG, from January 1, 2021 until the earlier of September 30, 2021 and the achievement of financial completion, at which time any deferred distributions will be released. A delay that results in a failure to achieve financial completion by September 30, 2021 would result in an event of default under Cameron LNG JV's financing agreements and a potential demand on Sempra Energy's guarantees. We anticipate that the guarantees will be terminated in the first half of 2021, but this timing could be delayed, perhaps substantially, if the operational performance tests required to achieve financial completion are not completed due to weather related events, other events or other factors beyond our control. If, due to Cameron LNG JV's failure to satisfy the financial completion criteria by the applicable deadline, we are required to repay some or all of the $4.0 billion under our guarantees, any such repayments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.",4.0,"['Debt instrument, maximum borrowing amount', 'Maximum exposure of guarantor obligations']",us-gaap_GuaranteeObligationsMaximumExposure,monetaryItemType,sre,"As we discuss below in “Off Balance Sheet Arrangements” and in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Sempra Energy has guaranteed a maximum of $4.0 billion related to Cameron LNG JV’s project financing and financing related agreements for the Phase 1 project.",$4.0 billion,MONEY,"As we discuss below in “Off Balance Sheet Arrangements” and in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Sempra Energy has guaranteed a maximum of $4.0 billion related to Cameron LNG JV’s project financing and financing related agreements for the Phase 1 project.","['maximum', 'related agreements for project', 'Sempra Energy', 'project financing']","['maximum', 0.7792462110519409, 'what is maximum ?', '$4.0 billion']",maximum,0.7792462110519409,what is maximum ?,$4.0 billion,Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
