12,"Workers' compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve a claim. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in healthcare costs, the results of any related litigation and with respect to workers' compensation claims, changes in legislation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in a future year for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from actuarial projections. All of these factors can result in revisions to actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Based on our historical experience, during 2019 we changed our self insurance reserves from the central estimate to the low end of the actuarial range of losses.
