19,"1. ORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATIONStructure of OperationsThe information in the notes and related commentary are presented in a format that includes data grouped as follows:Equipment Operations-Represents the enterprise without financial services, while including the company's agriculture and turf operations, construction and forestry operations, and other corporate assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses not reflected within financial services.Financial Services-Includes primarily the company's financing operations.Consolidated-Represents the consolidation of the equipment operations and financial services. References to ""Deere & Company"" or ""the company"" refer to the entire enterprise.Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements represent primarily the consolidation of all companies in which Deere & Company has a controlling interest. Certain variable interest entities (VIEs) are consolidated since the company is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. Deere & Company records its investment in each unconsolidated affiliated company (generally 20 to 50 percent ownership) at its related equity in the net assets of such affiliate (see Note 11). Other investments (less than 20 percent ownership) are recorded at cost.Fiscal YearThe company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in the reporting period. The fiscal year ends for 2020, 2019, and 2018 were November 1, 2020, November 3, 2019, and October 28, 2018, respectively.

At the time a sale is recognized, the estimated future warranty costs are recorded. The company generally determines its total warranty liability by applying historical warranty claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of five year claims costs with consideration of current quality developments. The company also offers extended warranty arrangements for purchase at the customer's option. The premiums for extended warranties are recognized in ""Other income"" in the statement of consolidated income primarily in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period.

The adoption was for clarifications to ASU No. 2017 12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities​No. 2020 04—Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which establishes ASC 848, Reference Rate Reform​​New Accounting Standards to be AdoptedIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which establishes ASC 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses. The ASU, along with related amendments, revises the measurement of credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost from an incurred loss to an expected loss methodology. The ASU affects receivables, debt securities, net investment in leases, and most other financial assets that represent a right to receive cash. The company holds deposits from dealers (dealer deposits) to absorb certain credit losses. Prior to adopting this ASU, the allowance for credit losses was estimated on probable credit losses incurred after consideration of dealer deposits. The ASU considers dealer deposits and certain credit insurance contracts as freestanding credit enhancements. As a result, after adoption, credit losses recovered from dealer deposits and credit insurance contracts will be presented in ""Other income"" and no longer as part of the allowance for credit losses or the provision for credit losses. The ASU will also modify the treatment of the estimated write off of delinquent receivables by no longer including the estimated benefit of charges to the dealer deposit in the write off amount (see Note 13). This change will increase the estimated write offs on delinquent financing receivables with the benefit of credit losses recovered from dealer deposits also presented in ""Other income."" This benefit, in both situations, will be recorded when the dealer deposits are charged and no longer based on estimated recoveries.The ASU also requires additional disclosures about significant estimates and credit quality. The effective date is the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.
