Entities are required to apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. Based on the conducted analyses and due to the nature and extent of 3M's financial instruments in scope of this ASU (primarily accounts receivable) and the historical, current and expected credit quality of its customers, the Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.​In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017 12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities and in October 2018, issued ASU No. 2018 16, which amended the standard. The ASU amends existing guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain situations and allow companies to better align their hedge accounting with their risk management activities. Existing standards contain certain requirements for an instrument to qualify for hedge accounting relative to initial and ongoing assessments of hedge effectiveness. While an initial quantitative test to establish the hedge relationship is highly effective would still be required, the new ASU permits subsequent qualitative assessments for certain hedges instead of a quantitative test and expands the timeline for performing the initial quantitative assessment. The ASU also simplifies related accounting by eliminating the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness. Instead, for qualifying cash flow and net investment hedges, the entire change in fair value (including the amount attributable to ineffectiveness) will be recorded within other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same income statement line that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. For fair value hedges, generally, the entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument would also be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The new standard also simplifies the accounting for fair value hedges of interest rate risks and expands an entity's ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components. In addition, the guidance also eases certain documentation requirements, modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and requires additional tabular disclosures of derivative and hedge related information. For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2019, with a modified retrospective transition resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the adoption date. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on 3M's consolidated results of operations and financial condition.​In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018 02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which permits entities to reclassify, to retained earnings, the one time income tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) arising from the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. An entity that elects to make this reclassification must consider all items in AOCI that have tax effects stranded as a result of the tax rate change, and must disclose the reclassification of these tax effects as well as the entity's policy for releasing income tax effects from AOCI. The ASU may be applied either retrospectively or as of the beginning of the period of adoption. For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2019 and resulted in a reclassification between retained earnings and AOCI. As a result of adopting this ASU, the Company increased retained earnings by approximately $0.9 billion, with an offsetting increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss for the same amount.​In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018 15, Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract, which aligns the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement (i.e. hosting arrangement) with the guidance on capitalizing costs in ASC 350 40, Internal Use Software. The ASU permits either a prospective or retrospective transition approach. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2020 and the Company plans on prospective adoption. While the Company utilized limited cloud computing services where significant implementation costs were incurred for the periods presented, 3M will apply this ASU to its expected expanded use of applicable services.​In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019 12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740). This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by, among other things, eliminating certain existing exceptions related to the general approach in ASC 740 relating to franchise taxes, reducing complexity in the interim period accounting for year to date loss limitations and changes in tax laws, and clarifying the accounting for transactions outside of business combination that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill. The transition requirements are primarily prospective and the effective date for 3M is January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted.
