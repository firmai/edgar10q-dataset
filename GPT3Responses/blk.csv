48,"Consolidation. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity's legal organization, the entity's capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company's involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (""PB"") of the entity. VREs are typically consolidated if the Company holds the majority voting interest. Upon the occurrence of certain events (such as contributions and redemptions, either by the Company, or third parties, or amendments to the governing documents of the Company's investment products), management reviews and reconsiders its previous conclusion regarding the status of an entity as a VIE or a VRE. Additionally, management continually reconsiders whether the Company is deemed to be a VIE's PB that consolidates such entity. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Certain investment products for which a controlling financial interest is achieved through arrangements that do not involve or are not directly linked to voting interests are deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including whether or not i) the entity has equity at risk that is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from other parties and ii) the equity holders at risk have the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns, and the right to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock re evaluates such factors as facts and circumstances change. The PB of a VIE is defined as the variable interest holder that has a controlling financial interest in the VIE. A controlling financial interest is defined as (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities. BlackRock is required to consolidate an investee to the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a greater than 50% voting equity interest. Retention of Specialized Investment Company Accounting Principles. Upon consolidation of sponsored investment funds, the Company retains the specialized investment company accounting principles of the underlying funds. All of the underlying investments held by such consolidated sponsored investment funds are carried at fair value with corresponding changes in the investments' fair values reflected in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. When the Company no longer controls these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for as an equity method investment or equity securities FVTNI if the Company still maintains an investment.",10,"['VIE, economic interest percentage']",us-gaap_VariableInterestEntityOwnershipPercentage,percentItemType,blk,The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%.,10%,PERCENT,The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%.,"['economic interest of greater %', 'economic interest', 'greater %', 'such VIEs', 'equity ownership']","['economic interest', 0.8851936459541321, 'what is economic interest ?', '10% or greater']",economic interest,0.8851936459541321,what is economic interest ?,10% or greater, economic interest
49,"Separate Account Collateral Assets Held and Liabilities Under Securities Lending Agreements. The Company facilitates securities lending arrangements whereby securities held by separate accounts maintained by BlackRock Life Limited are lent to third parties under global master securities lending agreements. In exchange, the Company receives legal title to the collateral with minimum values generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the securities lent in order to reduce counterparty risk. The required collateral value is calculated on a daily basis. The global master securities lending agreements provide the Company the right to request additional collateral or, in the event of borrower default, the right to liquidate collateral. The securities lending transactions entered into by the Company are accompanied by an agreement that entitles the Company to request the borrower to return the securities at any time; therefore, these transactions are not reported as sales. The Company records on the consolidated statements of financial condition the cash and noncash collateral received under these BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The securities lending revenue earned from lending securities held by the separate accounts is included in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. During 2019 and 2018, the Company had not resold or repledged any of the collateral received under these arrangements. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of loaned securities held by separate accounts was approximately $14.4 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively, and the fair value of the collateral held under these securities lending agreements was approximately $15.5 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively.",102,['Collateral cash and securities received in exchange of value of securities lent in order to reduce counterparty risk'],blk_CollateralCashAndSecuritiesReceivedInExchangeOfValueOfSecuritiesLentInOrderToReduceCreditRisk,percentItemType,blk,"In exchange, the Company receives legal title to the collateral with minimum values generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the securities lent in order to reduce counterparty risk.",approximately 102% to 112%,PERCENT,"In exchange, the Company receives legal title to the collateral with minimum values generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the securities lent in order to reduce counterparty risk.","['collateral with minimum values', '% of value', 'value of securities', 'legal title', 'minimum values', 'counterparty risk']","['securities lent', 0.15279673039913177, 'What is approximately 102% to 112% ?', 'securities lent']",securities lent,0.1527967303991317,What is approximately 102% to 112% ?,securities lent,value of securities lent
