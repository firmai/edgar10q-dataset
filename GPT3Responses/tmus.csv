EIP receivables are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amortized cost basis (i.e., the receivables' unpaid principal balance adjusted for any write offs and unamortized discounts), net of the allowance for expected credit losses. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest if the term exceeds 12 months as there is no stated rate of interest on the receivables. The receivables are recorded at their present value, which is determined by discounting expected future cash payments at the imputed interest rate. This adjustment results in a discount or reduction in transaction price which is allocated to the performance obligations and reduces Service revenues and Equipment revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The imputed discount rate is the current market interest rate and is predominately comprised of the estimated credit risk underlying the EIP receivable, reflecting the estimated credit worthiness of the customer.
