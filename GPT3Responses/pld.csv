Through the OP, we are engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development and management of logistics facilities with a focus on key markets in 19 countries on four continents. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we co invest with partners and investors. We maintain a significant level of ownership in these co investment ventures, which may be consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity. Our current business strategy consists of two operating business segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital. Our Real Estate Operations segment represents the ownership and development of logistics properties. Our Strategic Capital segment represents the management of unconsolidated co investment ventures and other ventures. See Note 17 for further discussion of our business segments.

The terms ""the Company,"" ""Prologis,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us"" means the Parent and OP collectively. For each share of preferred or common stock the Parent issues, the OP issues a corresponding preferred or common partnership unit, as applicable, to the Parent in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuance. At December 31, 2020, the Parent owned a 97.35% common general partnership interest in the OP and 100% of the preferred units in the OP.

Leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of Other Assets and all other capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of the real estate assets. Recoverability of Real Estate Assets. We assess the carrying values of our respective long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. This assessment is primarily triggered based on the shortening of the expected hold period due to our change in intent to sell a property in the near term. We have processes to monitor our intent with regard to our investments and the estimated disposition value in comparison to the current carrying value. If our assessment of potential triggering events indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to sell in the near term is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property. We determine the fair value of the property based on the proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on quoted market values, third party appraisals or discounted cash flow models that utilize the future rental income of the property and expected market capitalization rates. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. Changes in economic and operating conditions could impact our intent and the assumptions used in determining the fair value that could result in future impairment. In addition to monitoring for triggering events, we measure the recoverability of our assets by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. We estimate the future undiscounted cash flows and fair value based on our intent as follows: • for real estate properties that we intend to hold long term; including land held for development, properties currently under development and operating properties; recoverability is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future net rental income from operating the property and the terminal value, including anticipated costs to develop; • for real estate properties we intend to sell, including properties currently under development and operating properties; recoverability is assessed based on proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on the future net rental income of the property, expected market capitalization rates and anticipated costs to develop; • for land parcels we intend to sell, recoverability is assessed based on the estimated proceeds from disposition; and • for costs incurred related to the potential acquisition of land and operating properties and future development projects, recoverability is assessed based on the probability that the acquisition or development is likely to occur at the measurement date.",21.2,['Capitalized cost'],pld_InternalLeasingCostsCapitalizedGross,monetaryItemType,pld,"During the year ended December 31, 2018, we capitalized $21.2 million of internal costs related to our leasing activities.",$21.2 million,MONEY,"During the year ended December 31, 2018, we capitalized $21.2 million of internal costs related to our leasing activities.","['internal costs', 'leasing activities']","['internal costs related to our leasing activities', 0.616946280002594, 'What is $21.2 million ?', 'internal costs related to our leasing activities']",internal costs related to our leasing activities,0.616946280002594,What is $21.2 million ?,internal costs related to our leasing activities,Internal costs related to leasing activities

26,"Income Taxes. Under the IRC, REITs are generally not required to pay federal income taxes if they distribute 100% of their taxable income and meet certain income, asset and stockholder tests. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years. Even as a REIT, we may be subject to certain foreign, state and local taxes on our own income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. We have elected taxable REIT subsidiary (""TRS"") status for some of our consolidated subsidiaries. This allows us to provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs. Many of the foreign countries in which we have operations do not recognize REITs or do not accord REIT status under their respective tax laws to our entities that operate in their jurisdiction. In the U.S., we are taxed in certain states in which we operate. Accordingly, we recognize income tax expense for the federal and state income taxes incurred by our TRSs, taxes incurred in certain states and foreign jurisdictions, and interest and penalties associated with our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. We evaluate tax positions taken in the Consolidated Financial Statements under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of this evaluation, we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities. We recognize deferred income taxes in certain taxable entities. For federal income tax purposes, certain acquisitions have been treated as tax free transactions resulting in a carry over basis in assets and liabilities. For financial reporting purposes and in accordance with purchase accounting, we record all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their relative fair value at date of acquisition, as discussed above. For our taxable subsidiaries, including certain international jurisdictions, we recognize the deferred income tax liabilities that represent the tax effect of the difference between the tax basis carried over and the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets at date of acquisition. Any subsequent increases or decreases to the deferred income tax liability recorded in connection with these acquisitions, are reflected in earnings. If taxable income is generated in these subsidiaries, we recognize a benefit in earnings as a result of the reversal of the deferred income tax liability previously recorded at the acquisition date and we record current income tax expense representing the entire current income tax liability. If the reversal of the deferred income tax liability results from a sale or contribution of assets, the classification of the reversal to the Consolidated Statements of Income is based on the taxability of the transaction. If the sale or contribution is of the real estate asset and results in a taxable transaction, the reversal is recorded to deferred income tax benefit. If the sale or contribution is the disposition of the entity that owns the asset, the reversal is recorded through gains. Deferred income tax expense is generally a function of the period's temporary differences (items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes) and the utilization of tax net operating losses (""NOL"") generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets. We provide for a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets if we believe all or some portion of the deferred income tax asset may not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances that causes a change in the estimated ability to realize the related deferred income tax asset is included in deferred tax expense.",100,['Percentage of taxable income distribute'],pld_DistributableIncomePercentageForTaxExemption,percentItemType,pld,"Under the IRC, REITs are generally not required to pay federal income taxes if they distribute 100% of their taxable income and meet certain income, asset and stockholder tests.",100%,PERCENT,"Under the IRC, REITs are generally not required to pay federal income taxes if they distribute 100% of their taxable income and meet certain income, asset and stockholder tests.","['% of taxable income', 'federal income taxes', 'taxable income']","['% of taxable income', 0.9829632043838501, 'what is % of taxable income ?', '100%']",% of taxable income,0.98296320438385,what is % of taxable income ?,100%,Taxable income

28,"New Accounting Pronouncements. New Accounting Standards Adopted Accounting for Lease Concessions Related to the Effects of the Coronavirus (""COVID 19"") Pandemic. In April 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued a Staff Question and Answer (""Q&A"") to clarify whether lease concessions related to the effects of COVID 19 require the application of the lease modification guidance under the new lease standard, which we adopted on January 1, 2019. For rent deferrals granted during the year ended December 31, 2020, we are allowing customers to defer rental payments until a later period than was originally contracted under the lease in exchange for a note receivable, and we are continuing to recognize rental revenue during the period. In accordance with the Q&A, we are electing to not apply the lease modification guidance to concessions that result in deferred rent as the total cash flows required by the modified lease agreements are materially the same as the cash flows required under the original lease and there are no substantive changes to the consideration. During 2020, we deferred approximately $23 million of rental payments which represented less than 1% of our total consolidated rental revenue for 2020. At January 25, 2021, we had collected approximately $16 million, or 98%, of the deferred payments due at December 31st, with the remainder due in 2021. If we grant concessions to a customer that modify the terms and significantly change the underlying cash flows of the original lease for the remaining term, we will account for these changes as a lease modification in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reference Rate Reform. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority and other independent groups announced they intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of the London Inter bank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") after 2021. As a result, in the U.S., the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR in debt and derivative financial instruments. Additionally, other global regulators have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify a preferred alternative rate for other interbank offered rates (""IBORs""). Both LIBOR and IBOR are herein referred to as ""IBOR indexed rate"". In November 2020, the Federal Reserve Board along with various independent groups announced the potential for certain USD LIBOR tenors to continue to be published until June 2023. This change would allow most legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature before disruptions occur in the USD LIBOR market, without the need to transition those contracts to SOFR. In March 2020, the FASB issued an Accounting Standard Update (""ASU"") that provided practical expedients to address existing guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting due to the expected market transition from an IBOR indexed rate to alternative reference rates, such as SOFR for LIBOR. We refer to this transition as ""reference rate reform."" The first practical expedient within the ASU allows companies to elect to not apply certain modification accounting requirements to debt, derivative and lease contracts affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. These criteria include the following: (i) the contract referenced an IBOR indexed rate that is expected to be discontinued; (ii) the modified terms directly replace or have the potential to replace the IBOR indexed rate that is expected to be discontinued; and (iii) any contemporaneous changes to other terms that change or have the potential to change the amount and timing of contractual cash flows must be related to the replacement of the IBOR indexed rate. If the contract meets all three criteria, there is no requirement for remeasurement of the contract at the modification date or reassessment of the previous accounting determination. The second practical expedient allows companies to change the reference rate and other critical terms related to the reference rate reform in derivative hedge documentation without having to dedesignate the hedging relationship. This allows for companies to continue applying hedge accounting to existing cash flow and net investment hedges. The ASU was effective upon issuance on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2020 and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. We have not modified any contracts to date however, we will evaluate any debt, derivative and lease contracts that are modified in the future to ensure they are eligible for modification relief and apply the practical expedients as needed.",23,['Deferred rental payment'],us-gaap_DeferredRentCredit,monetaryItemType,pld,"During 2020, we deferred approximately $23 million of rental payments which represented less than 1% of our total consolidated rental revenue for 2020.",approximately $23 million,MONEY,"During 2020, we deferred approximately $23 million of rental payments which represented less than 1% of our total consolidated rental revenue for 2020.","['% of total rental revenue', 'rental payments', 'total rental revenue']","['rental payments', 0.9835585355758667, 'What is approximately $23 million ?', 'rental payments']",rental payments,0.9835585355758668,What is approximately $23 million ?,rental payments,rental payments
29,"New Accounting Pronouncements. New Accounting Standards Adopted Accounting for Lease Concessions Related to the Effects of the Coronavirus (""COVID 19"") Pandemic. In April 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued a Staff Question and Answer (""Q&A"") to clarify whether lease concessions related to the effects of COVID 19 require the application of the lease modification guidance under the new lease standard, which we adopted on January 1, 2019. For rent deferrals granted during the year ended December 31, 2020, we are allowing customers to defer rental payments until a later period than was originally contracted under the lease in exchange for a note receivable, and we are continuing to recognize rental revenue during the period. In accordance with the Q&A, we are electing to not apply the lease modification guidance to concessions that result in deferred rent as the total cash flows required by the modified lease agreements are materially the same as the cash flows required under the original lease and there are no substantive changes to the consideration. During 2020, we deferred approximately $23 million of rental payments which represented less than 1% of our total consolidated rental revenue for 2020. At January 25, 2021, we had collected approximately $16 million, or 98%, of the deferred payments due at December 31st, with the remainder due in 2021. If we grant concessions to a customer that modify the terms and significantly change the underlying cash flows of the original lease for the remaining term, we will account for these changes as a lease modification in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reference Rate Reform. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority and other independent groups announced they intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of the London Inter bank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") after 2021. As a result, in the U.S., the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR in debt and derivative financial instruments. Additionally, other global regulators have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify a preferred alternative rate for other interbank offered rates (""IBORs""). Both LIBOR and IBOR are herein referred to as ""IBOR indexed rate"". In November 2020, the Federal Reserve Board along with various independent groups announced the potential for certain USD LIBOR tenors to continue to be published until June 2023. This change would allow most legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature before disruptions occur in the USD LIBOR market, without the need to transition those contracts to SOFR.
