18,"NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. (""Ascent"") was incorporated on October 18, 2005 from the separation by ITN Energy Systems, Inc. (""ITN"") of its Advanced Photovoltaic Division and all of that division's key personnel and core technologies. ITN, a private company incorporated in 1994, is an incubator dedicated to the development of thin film, photovoltaic (""PV""), battery, fuel cell and nano technologies. Through its work on research and development contracts for private and governmental entities, ITN developed proprietary processing and manufacturing know how applicable to PV products generally, and to Copper Indium Gallium diSelenide (""CIGS"") PV products in particular. ITN formed Ascent to commercialize its investment in CIGS PV technologies. In January 2006, in exchange for 102,800 shares of common stock of Ascent, ITN assigned to Ascent certain CIGS PV technologies and trade secrets and granted to Ascent a perpetual, exclusive, royalty free worldwide license to use, in connection with the manufacture, development, marketing and commercialization of CIGS PV to produce solar power, certain of ITN's existing and future proprietary and control technologies that, although non specific to CIGS PV, Ascent believes will be useful in its production of PV modules for its target markets. Upon receipt of the necessary government approvals and pursuant to novation in early 2007, ITN assigned government funded research and development contracts to Ascent and also transferred the key personnel working on the contracts to Ascent. Currently, the Company is focusing on integrating its PV products into high value markets such as aerospace, satellites, near earth orbiting vehicles, and fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The value proposition of Ascent's proprietary solar technology not only aligns with the needs of customers in these industries, but also overcomes many of the obstacles other solar technologies face in these unique markets. Ascent has the capability to design and develop finished products for end users in these areas as well as collaborate with strategic partners to design and develop custom integrated solutions for products like fixed wing UAVs. Ascent sees significant overlap of the needs of end users across some of these industries and can achieve economies of scale in sourcing, development, and production in commercializing products for these customers.","102,800",['Common stock issued'],us-gaap_StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesAcquisitions,sharesItemType,asti,"In January 2006, in exchange for 102,800 shares of common stock of Ascent, ITN assigned to Ascent certain CIGS PV technologies and trade secrets and granted to Ascent a perpetual, exclusive, royalty free worldwide license to use, in connection with the manufacture, development, marketing and commercialization of CIGS PV to produce solar power, certain of ITN’s existing and future proprietary and control technologies that, although non specific to CIGS PV, Ascent believes will be useful in its production of PV modules for its target markets.","102,800",CARDINAL,"In January 2006, in exchange for 102,800 shares of common stock of Ascent, ITN assigned to Ascent certain CIGS PV technologies and trade secrets and granted to Ascent a perpetual, exclusive, royalty free worldwide license to use, in connection with the manufacture, development, marketing and commercialization of CIGS PV to produce solar power, certain of ITN’s existing and future proprietary and control technologies that, although non specific to CIGS PV, Ascent believes will be useful in its production of PV modules for its target markets.","['exchange for shares', 'shares of common stock', 'common stock of Ascent', 'connection with manufacture', 'manufacture of CIGS PV', 'production of PV modules', 'production for target markets', 'common stock', 'CIGS PV technologies', 'perpetual free worldwide license', 'CIGS PV', 'solar power', 'certain proprietary technologies', 'PV modules', 'target markets']","['solar power', 0.9494760632514954, 'how many solar power ?', '102,800']",solar power,0.9494760632514954,how many solar power ?,"102,800",common stock of Ascent
