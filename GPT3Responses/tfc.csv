2,NPAs include NPLs and foreclosed property. Foreclosed property consists of real estate and other assets acquired as a result of clients' loan defaults. Truist's policies for placing loans on nonperforming status conform to guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Truist classifies loans and leases as past due when the payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is greater than 30 days delinquent or if one payment is past due. Payment deferrals granted as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic do not result in a loan becoming past due. The following table summarizes the delinquency thresholds that are a factor used in evaluating nonperforming classification and the timing of charge off evaluations:(number of days)Placed on Nonperforming (1) (2)Evaluated for Charge off (2)Commercial:Commercial and industrial90(3)90(3)CRE90(3)90(3)Commercial construction90(3)90(3)Consumer:Residential mortgage (4)90to18090to180Residential home equity and direct (4)90to12090to180Indirect auto (4)90120Indirect other (4)90to12090to120Student (5) (6)NA120to180Credit card (7)NA90to180,30,['Threshold Period For Past Due Classification for Loans and Leases Receivable'],tfc_ThresholdPeriodPastDueClassificationforLoansandLeasesReceivable,durationItemType,tfc,Truist classifies loans and leases as past due when the payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is greater than 30 days delinquent or if one payment is past due.,greater than 30 days,DATE,Truist classifies loans and leases as past due when the payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is greater than 30 days delinquent or if one payment is past due.,"['classifies due loans', 'payment of principal', 'contractual terms']","['payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms', 0.3783000111579895, 'What is greater than 30 days ?', 'payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms']",payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms,0.3783000111579895,What is greater than 30 days ?,payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms,loans and leases classified as past due

4,"Assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less estimated cost to sell and subsequently carried at LOCOM. Net realizable value equals fair value less estimated selling costs. Any excess of cost over net realizable value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the ALLL. NPAs are subject to periodic revaluations of the collateral underlying impaired loans and foreclosed real estate. The periodic revaluations are generally based on the appraised value of the property and may include additional liquidity adjustments based upon the expected retention period. Truist's policies require that valuations be updated at least annually and that upon foreclosure, the valuation must not be more than six months old, otherwise an update is required. Any subsequent changes in value as well as gains or losses from the disposition of these assets are recognized in Other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

5,"Truist's policy is to review and individually evaluate the reserve for all nonperforming lending relationships and TDRs with an outstanding balance of $5 million or more, as such lending relationships do not typically share similar risk characteristics with others. Individually evaluated reserves are based on current forecasts, the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or the value of collateral, which is generally based on appraisals, recent sales of foreclosed properties and/or relevant property specific market information. Truist has elected to measure expected credit losses on collateral dependent loans based on the fair value of the collateral. Loans are considered collateral dependent when it is probable that Truist will be unable to collect principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the agreement and repayment is expected to be provided substantially by the sale or continued operation of the underlying collateral. Commercial loans are typically secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories, and other types of collateral.",5,['Threshold amount to establish a reserve on nonaccrual loans and TDRs'],tfc_FinancingReceivableThresholdAmountForReviewInDeterminingReservesNonaccrualStatusOrTDR,monetaryItemType,tfc,"Truist’s policy is to review and individually evaluate the reserve for all nonperforming lending relationships and TDRs with an outstanding balance of $5 million or more, as such lending relationships do not typically share similar risk characteristics with others.",$5 million,MONEY,"Truist’s policy is to review and individually evaluate the reserve for all nonperforming lending relationships and TDRs with an outstanding balance of $5 million or more, as such lending relationships do not typically share similar risk characteristics with others.","['nonperforming lending relationships with outstanding balance', 'outstanding balance', 'lending relationships', 'outstanding balance', 'such lending relationships', 'similar risk characteristics']","['nonperforming lending relationships with outstanding balance', 0.7029564380645752, 'what is nonperforming lending relationships with outstanding balance ?', '$5 million or more']",nonperforming lending relationships with outstanding balance,0.7029564380645752,what is nonperforming lending relationships with outstanding balance ?,$5 million or more,Nonperforming lending relationships
