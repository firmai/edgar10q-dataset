We adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2019 using a modified retrospective transition method and elected the following practical expedients: (i) the optional transition method that allows us to apply the guidance at the adoption date and recognize any adjustments that result from applying Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") Topic 842, Leases, to existing leases as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings/(deficit) in the period of adoption (i.e., the effective date); (ii) the package of practical expedients that allows us to carry forward our determination of whether a lease exists, the classification of a lease, and whether initial direct lease costs exist for purposes of transition to the new standard; (iii) the land easement option, which allows us to continue to use prior accounting conclusions reached in our accounting for land easements; and (iv) the short term lease exemption whereby we will not record an asset or liability for short term leases. The most significant impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases. Our accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged. Upon adoption, we had total lease assets of $821 million and total lease liabilities of $887 million. The adoption of this ASU did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings/(deficit) and did not impact our consolidated statements of income or our cash flows.

21,"In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018 02 related to reclassifying tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""U.S. Tax Reform"") enacted on December 22, 2017. U.S. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of such changes in tax laws or rates to be presented in net income/(loss) from continuing operations. However, the related tax effects of such deferred tax assets and liabilities may have been originally recorded in other comprehensive income/(loss). This ASU allows companies to reclassify such stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) to retained earnings/(deficit). This reclassification adjustment is optional, and if elected, may be applied either to the period of adoption or retrospectively to the period(s) impacted by U.S. Tax Reform. Additionally, this ASU requires companies to disclose the policy election for stranded tax effects as well as the general accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). This ASU became effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. We adopted this ASU on the first day of our fiscal year 2019 and made the policy election to reclassify stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) to retained earnings/(deficit) in the period of adoption. The impact of this policy election was an increase to retained earnings/(deficit) and a corresponding decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) of $136 million.
