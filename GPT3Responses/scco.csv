Generally, 80% to 90% of the Company's metal production is sold under annual or longer term contracts, which specify a volume of mineral to be sold over a stated period and delivery schedule; the price at which mineral will be sold at each delivery date is generally determined by the weekly or monthly average rate of the commodity published by major metal exchanges at specific dates stipulated within each contract. The Company considers each contract to be a single performance obligation, represented by the delivery of a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same, with the same pattern of transfer to the Company's customers. The Company concluded this as, based on the nature of its contracts, customers receive the benefit of mineral sold as it is shipped per the terms of the contracts at each contractual delivery date. Likewise, each shipment of product represents the same measure of progress as other shipments within the contract. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenues for each contract over the period of time in which the specified quantity of mineral is delivered. In doing so, the Company considers that it has a right to consideration from its customers in an amount that corresponds directly to the value transferred to those customers that being the quantity of mineral delivered at the price per unit delivered. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice (the invoice practical expedient), as it believes that this method is a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods to its customers. ​For contracts with a term greater than one year, the Company is unable to disclose an allocation of the transaction price to the remaining unsatisfied performance obligation, given that unit prices of mineral sold are determined by published commodity prices at specified dates within the contract. The volume of mineral to be delivered after the first year of the contract is subject to annual volume negotiations in accordance with the terms of the contract. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has long term contracts with promises to deliver in 2022 for a total of 118,000 metric tonnes of copper concentrate, 48,000 metric tonnes of copper cathodes, 37,594 tonnes of molybdenum concentrate and 367,720 tonnes of sulfuric acid.

The Company provides allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts.​Substantially all of the Company's sales are made under carriage and insurance paid to, or cost, insurance and freight Incoterms, whereby the Company is responsible for providing shipping and insurance after control of the inventory has been transferred to the customer. According to the terms of the Company's contracts, these services are not distinct within the context of the contract, and they are not separately identifiable from the other promises within the contract. Additionally, it is the Company policy and it has a long standing history of providing shipping and insurance services to its customers. Accordingly, shipping and insurance are not considered separate performance obligations. The related costs of shipping and insurance are presented within the cost of sales line in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. ​Furthermore, the Company considered the impact of the shipping and insurance services on the determination of when control is transferred to its customers. It has concluded that the terms of these services do not impact its customers' ability to sell, pledge, or otherwise use the products in shipment. Also, there is a small likelihood and minimal history of lost or damaged goods during shipment. Considering these factors, combined with the other indicators of control previously mentioned, the Company has concluded that these services do not impact the determination that control is transferred at the point of origin.​For certain of the Company's sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and occasionally in some cases a few additional months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract.​These provisional pricing arrangements are accounted for separately from the contract as an embedded derivative instrument under ASC 815 30 ""Derivatives and Hedging—Cash Flow Hedges.""

Income from subsidiaries, such as Minera Mexico, is included in the Global Intangible Low Tax Income or GILTI.​GILTI imposes a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The Company has not had U.S. tax liability from the GILTI inclusion since introduction of this tax in 2018 and does not anticipate a tax in the future because of increased fixed asset amounts and the Mexican tax rate of 30%. No U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded as the Company has elected that if GILTI were to apply in the future, a current period expense would be recorded when incurred.​The Base Erosion Anti Abuse Tax (BEAT) is a 10% minimum tax for the years 2019 through 2025 and 12.5% in years thereafter. It is calculated on a base equal to the Company's income determined without the tax benefit arising from base erosion payments. Since this tax was imposed in 2018 the Company has had no U.S. tax liability for BEAT since it has met the safe harbor rule that provides a Company not to be subject to the BEAT if related party payments from the U.S. to foreign entities does not exceed 3% of expenses excluding cost of goods sold.
