In November 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018 19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses. These updates provide an option to irrevocably elect to measure certain individual financial assets at fair value instead of amortized cost and provide additional clarification and implementation guidance on certain aspects of the previously issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016 13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (""ASU 2016 13"") and have the same effective date and transition requirements as ASU 2016 13. ASU 2016 13 introduces a current expected credit loss model for measuring expected credit losses for certain types of financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. ASU 2016 13 replaces the incurred loss model for measuring expected credit losses, requires expected losses on available for sale debt securities to be recognized through an allowance for credit losses rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities and provides for additional disclosure requirements. ASU 2016 13 requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the balance sheet at the date of adoption and a prospective transition approach for debt securities for which an other than temporary impairment had been recognized before the adoption date. The effect of a prospective transition approach is to maintain the same amortized cost basis before and after the date of adoption.
