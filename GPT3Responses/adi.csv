25,"Foreign Exchange Exposure Management — The Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to offset certain operational and balance sheet exposures from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from the portion of the Company's operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro; other significant exposures include the British Pound, Philippine Peso and the Japanese Yen. Derivative instruments are employed to eliminate or minimize certain foreign currency exposures that can be confidently identified and quantified. These foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to support transactions made in the normal course of business, and accordingly, are not speculative in nature. The contracts are for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions, generally one year or less. Hedges related to anticipated transactions are matched with the underlying exposures at inception and designated and documented as cash flow hedges. They are qualitatively evaluated for effectiveness on a quarterly basis. The gain or loss on the derivatives are reported as a component of AOCI in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the impact of the hedged transaction in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.",one year,['Contracts period'],adi_ContractsPeriod,durationItemType,adi,"The contracts are for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions, generally one year or less.",one year,DATE,"The contracts are for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions, generally one year or less.","['terms of underlying transactions', 'consistent periods']","['contracts', 0.14911608397960663, 'What is one year ?', 'contracts']",contracts,0.1491160839796066,What is one year ?,contracts,The contracts are for periods
