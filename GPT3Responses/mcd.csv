2,"In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued guidance codified in ASC Topic 326, ""Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurements of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments"". The standard replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in prior GAAP with a methodology that instead reflects a current estimate of all expected credit losses on financial assets, including receivables. The guidance requires that an entity measure and recognize expected credit losses at the time the asset is recorded, while considering a broader range of information to estimate credit losses including country specific macroeconomic conditions that correlate with historical loss experience, delinquency trends and aging behavior of receivables, among others. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2020, prospectively, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

47,"In 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Company's U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. In 2018, the IRS issued a RAR for these years. As expected, the RAR included the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR. Also in 2018, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. The transfer pricing matters for 2011 and 2012 are being addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 transfer pricing matters as part of the 2009 2010 appeals process. The Company is also under audit in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions for matters primarily related to transfer pricing, and the Company is under audit in multiple state tax jurisdictions. While the Company cannot estimate the impact to the effective tax rate, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to $1,040 million within the next 12 months. This would be due to the possible settlement of the IRS transfer pricing matters, completion of the aforementioned foreign and state tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions.","1,040",['Reasonably possible amount of unrecognized tax benefits decrease within the next 12 months   minimum'],us-gaap_DecreaseInUnrecognizedTaxBenefitsIsReasonablyPossible,monetaryItemType,mcd,"While the Company cannot estimate the impact to the effective tax rate, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to $1,040 million within the next 12 months.","$1,040 million",MONEY,"While the Company cannot estimate the impact to the effective tax rate, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to $1,040 million within the next 12 months.","['impact to effective tax rate', 'total amount of unrecognized tax benefits', 'effective tax rate', 'total amount', 'unrecognized tax benefits']","['total amount of unrecognized tax benefits', 0.8956761360168457, 'what is total amount of unrecognized tax benefits ?', '$1,040 million']",total amount of unrecognized tax benefits,0.8956761360168457,what is total amount of unrecognized tax benefits ?,"$1,040 million",unrecognized tax benefits
