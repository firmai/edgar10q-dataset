The acquired definite lived intangible assets consist of developed product rights and license agreements and are being amortized over a weighted average estimated useful life of approximately twelve years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the ""income approach"" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.",twelve years,['Weighted average useful life of acquired intangible assets'],us-gaap_AcquiredFiniteLivedIntangibleAssetsWeightedAverageUsefulLife,durationItemType,abbv,The acquired definite lived intangible assets consist of developed product rights and license agreements and are being amortized over a weighted average estimated useful life of approximately twelve years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit.,approximately twelve years,DATE,The acquired definite lived intangible assets consist of developed product rights and license agreements and are being amortized over a weighted average estimated useful life of approximately twelve years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit.,"['weighted average estimated useful life of years', 'estimated pattern of economic benefit', 'intangible assets', 'product rights', 'average useful life', 'economic benefit']","['average useful life', 0.4970458447933197, 'what is average useful life ?', 'approximately twelve years']",average useful life,0.4970458447933197,what is average useful life ?,approximately twelve years,The acquired definite lived intangible assets
