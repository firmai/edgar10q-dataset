2,"Revenue Recognition Schlumberger adopted Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2014 09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers on January 1, 2018. This ASU amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition and requires companies to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Under the transition method selected by Schlumberger, this ASU was applied only to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Prior period amounts were not adjusted and were reflected in accordance with Schlumberger's historical accounting. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on Schlumberger's Consolidated Financial Statements. Schlumberger recognizes revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for these products or services. The vast majority of Schlumberger's services and product offerings are short term in nature. The time between invoicing and when payment is due under these arrangements is generally between 30 to 60 days. Revenue is occasionally generated from contractual arrangements that include multiple performance obligations. Revenue from these arrangements is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using expected costs plus margin. Revenue is recognized for certain long term construction type contracts over time. These contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customer specific applications. Revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract. Progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs. The estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project. Revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims. Due to the nature of these projects, adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs may be required as work progresses. Progress billings are generally issued upon completion of certain phases of work as stipulated in the contract. Any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable. Due to the nature of its businesses, Schlumberger does not have significant backlog.

As a result, Schlumberger's market capitalization deteriorated significantly compared to the end of 2019. Schlumberger's stock price reached a low during the first quarter of 2020 not seen since 1995. Additionally, the Philadelphia Oil Services Sector index, which is comprised of companies involved in the oil services sector, reached an all time low. As a result of these facts, Schlumberger determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of certain of its reporting units was less than their carrying value. Therefore, Schlumberger performed an interim goodwill impairment test. Schlumberger had 11 reporting units with goodwill balances aggregating $16.0 billion. Schlumberger determined that the fair value of four of its reporting units, representing $4.5 billion of goodwill, was substantially in excess of their carrying value. Schlumberger performed a detailed quantitative impairment assessment of the remaining seven reporting units, which represented $11.5 billion of goodwill.

19,"Following the $3.1 billion goodwill impairment charge relating to these seven reporting units, six of these reporting units had a remaining goodwill balance. These goodwill balances ranged between $0.2 billion and $5.0 billion and aggregated to $8.4 billion as of March 31, 2020. Schlumberger used the income approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units, but also considered the market approach to validate the results. The income approach estimates the fair value by discounting each reporting unit's estimated future cash flows using Schlumberger's estimate of the discount rate, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate the discounted cash flow results. The market approach involves significant judgement involved in the selection of the appropriate peer group companies and valuation multiples. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the income approach include the estimated future net annual cash flows for each reporting unit and the discount rate. Schlumberger selected the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow projections using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and estimated growth rates. Schlumberger's estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable.

The discount rates utilized to value Schlumberger's reporting units were between 12.0% and 13.5%, depending on the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting unit as well as the size of the reporting unit.

Recoverability testing indicated that certain long lived assets were impaired. The estimated fair value of these assets was determined to be below their carrying value.
