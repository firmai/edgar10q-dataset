21,"In February 2016, the FASB issued its final standard on lease accounting, ASU No. 2016 02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" which superseded Topic 840, ""Leases."" which was further modified in ASU No. 2018 10, ""Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,"" ASU No. 2018 11, ""Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements"" and ASU No. 2019 01 ""Leases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements"" to clarify the implementation guidance. The new accounting standard was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019 and required the recognition on the balance sheet of right of use assets and lease liabilities for all long term leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet. The Company elected the optional transition method and adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2019, on a modified retrospective basis, with no restatement of prior period amounts. As allowed under the new accounting standard, the Company elected to apply practical expedients to carry forward the original lease determinations, lease classifications and accounting of initial direct costs for all asset classes at the time of adoption. The Company also elected not to separate lease components from non lease components and to exclude short term leases from its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company's adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of right of use assets of $458 and liabilities of $574, with no material cumulative effect adjustment to equity as of the date of adoption. In connection with the adoption of this guidance, as required, the Company reclassified certain restructuring reserves incurred in connection with the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and deferred rent liabilities as reductions to lease assets. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income or Cash Flows.

22,"In February 2016, the FASB issued its final standard on lease accounting, ASU No. 2016 02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" which superseded Topic 840, ""Leases."" which was further modified in ASU No. 2018 10, ""Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,"" ASU No. 2018 11, ""Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements"" and ASU No. 2019 01 ""Leases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements"" to clarify the implementation guidance. The new accounting standard was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019 and required the recognition on the balance sheet of right of use assets and lease liabilities for all long term leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet. The Company elected the optional transition method and adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2019, on a modified retrospective basis, with no restatement of prior period amounts. As allowed under the new accounting standard, the Company elected to apply practical expedients to carry forward the original lease determinations, lease classifications and accounting of initial direct costs for all asset classes at the time of adoption. The Company also elected not to separate lease components from non lease components and to exclude short term leases from its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company's adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of right of use assets of $458 and liabilities of $574, with no material cumulative effect adjustment to equity as of the date of adoption. In connection with the adoption of this guidance, as required, the Company reclassified certain restructuring reserves incurred in connection with the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and deferred rent liabilities as reductions to lease assets.
