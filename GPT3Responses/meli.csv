Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated for consolidation purposes.The Company determined that, effective December 1, 2017, evolving conditions in Venezuela have caused the Company to no longer meet the accounting criteria for control over its Venezuelan subsidiaries. The Venezuela's selective default determination, restrictive exchange controls and suspension of foreign exchange market that severely incremented the lack of access to U.S. dollars through official currency exchange mechanisms, plus the worsening in Venezuela macroeconomic environment, has resulted in other than temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and the U.S. dollar, and restricted the Company's ability to pay dividends and satisfy other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars. The currency controls in Venezuela have significantly limited the Company's ability to realize the benefits from earnings and to access to resulting liquidity of those operations. For accounting purposes, this lack of exchangeability has resulted in lack of control over Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, in accordance to the applicable accounting standards, as of December 1, 2017, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of its subsidiaries in Venezuela and began reporting the results under the cost method of accounting. Accordingly, since December 1, 2017, the Company no longer includes the results of its Venezuelan operations and recorded an impairment of $85,761 thousands as of December 31, 2017.Under the cost method of accounting, if cash were to be received from the Venezuela entity in future periods from its operations, dividends or royalties, income would be recognized. The Company does not anticipate dividend or royalty payments being made in the foreseeable future and has no outstanding receivables or payables with the Venezuelan entity. The factors that led to the Company's conclusion to deconsolidate its Venezuelan subsidiaries as of December 1, 2017 continued to exist through the date of this report. Despite the Venezuelan macroeconomic context, the Company will continue its operations in Venezuela for the foreseeable future. Further, the Company only recognizes revenue from intercompany service allocations to Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent the Company collects the respective receivables.Substantially all net revenues, cost of net revenues and operating expenses, are generated in the Company's foreign operations.

Merchant and consumers credits are repaid in a period ranging between 3 and 24 months. The Company closely monitors credit quality for all loans receivable on a recurring basis. To assess a merchant and consumers seeking a loan under the Mercado Credito solution, the Company uses, among other indicators, a risk model internally developed, as a credit quality indicator to help predict the merchant's ability to repay the principal balance and interest related to the credit. The risk model uses multiple variables as predictors of the merchant's ability to repay the credit, including external and internal indicators. Internal indicators consider merchant's annual sales volume, claims history, prior repayment history, and other measures. Based on internal scoring, merchants are rated from A (Prime) to F (Upper medium grade).

Historically, such charges have been within Management expectations. However, unexpected or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future statements of income or cash flows.
