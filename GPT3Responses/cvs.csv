44,"The Company's real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right of use asset and lease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the short term lease.",five years,['Lease renewal term'],cvs_LesseeOperatingAndFinanceLeasesRenewalTerm,durationItemType,cvs,The Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each.,up to five years,DATE,The Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each.,"['renewals for additional periods', 'additional periods of years', 'estate leases', 'additional periods']","['additional periods', 0.7405478954315186, 'what is additional periods ?', 'up to five years each']",additional periods,0.7405478954315186,what is additional periods ?,up to five years each,real estate leases
45,"The Company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable. The Company groups and evaluates these long lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group's carrying value that exceeds the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges).

47,"The Company analyzes historical claim payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates (i.e., the date services were provided) to claim payment dates to estimate ""completion factors."" The Company uses completion factors predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date. The Company estimates completion factors by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim payment and estimating the percentage of claims incurred for a given month that are complete by each month thereafter. For any given month, substantially all claims are paid within six months of the date of service, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are completely resolved and paid. These historically derived completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. The difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents the Company's estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in the Company's health care costs payable. The completion factors the Company uses reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim submission and processing patterns and, to a lesser extent, other factors such as changes in health care cost trend rates, changes in Insured membership and changes in product mix. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using the Company's completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than the ultimate cost of claims.",six months,['Period after date of service a claim is paid'],cvs_HealthCareCostsPayablePeriodAfterDateOfServicesClaimsArePaid,durationItemType,cvs,"For any given month, substantially all claims are paid within six months of the date of service, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are completely resolved and paid.",six months of the date,DATE,"For any given month, substantially all claims are paid within six months of the date of service, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are completely resolved and paid.","['date of service', 'date of service']","['', 0, '', '']",,0.0,,,substantially all claims are paid

49,"Unpaid claims consist primarily of reserves associated with certain short duration group disability and term life insurance contracts, including an estimate for IBNR as of the financial statement date. Reserves associated with certain short duration group disability and term life insurance contracts are based upon the Company's estimate of the present value of future benefits, which is based on assumed investment yields and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity and recoveries from the U.S. Social Security Administration. The Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider, among other things, contractual requirements, claim incidence rates, claim recovery rates, seasonality and other relevant factors. The Company discounts certain claim liabilities related to group long term disability and life insurance waiver of premium contracts. The discount rates generally reflect the Company's expected investment returns for the investments supporting all incurral years of these liabilities. The discount rates for retrospectively rated contracts are set at contractually specified levels. The Company's estimates of unpaid claims are subject to change due to changes in the underlying experience of the insurance contracts, changes in investment yields or other factors, and these changes are recorded in current and future benefits in the consolidated statements of operations in the period they are determined. The Company estimates its reserve for claims IBNR for life products largely based on completion factors. The completion factors used are based on the Company's historical experience and reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim payment patterns, changes in business volume and other factors. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than historical periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than required to cover future life benefit payments. There have been no significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company's estimate of unpaid claims IBNR in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, unpaid claims balances of $532 million and $1.5 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long term insurance liabilities, respectively.
