Factors incorporated into the calculation of lease discount rates include the valuations and yields of the Company's senior notes, their credit spread over comparable U.S. Treasury rates, and an index of the credit spreads for all North American investment grade companies by rating.

Because the standard was adopted under the modified retrospective approach, it did not impact the Company's historical consolidated net income or cash flows.​In February 2018, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for the reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income which gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings tax effects related to items that have been stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA""). An entity that elects to reclassify these amounts must reclassify stranded tax effects related to the TCJA's change in US federal tax rate for all items accounted for in other comprehensive income. These entities can also elect to reclassify other stranded effects that relate to the TCJA but do not directly relate to the change in the federal tax rate. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2019 and recorded a transition adjustment of $0.9 million, which is reflected as a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.​In October 2016, the FASB issued amendments to existing guidance related to accounting for intra entity transfers of assets other than inventory, which affected the Company's historical accounting for intra entity transfers of certain intangible assets. This guidance was effective for the Company in 2018. The amendments were applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted this guidance effective February 3, 2018 which resulted in an increase in deferred income tax liabilities and a decrease in retained earnings of $41.3 million.​In January 2017, the FASB issued amendments to existing guidance related to the subsequent measurement of goodwill. These amendments modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Subsequent to adoption, an entity will perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. An entity is required to disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition.
