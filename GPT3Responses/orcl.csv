18,"Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. The carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. When goodwill is assessed for impairment, we have the option to perform an assessment of qualitative factors of impairment (optional assessment) prior to necessitating a quantitative impairment test. Should the optional assessment be used for any given fiscal year, qualitative factors to consider for a reporting unit include: cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations; macroeconomic conditions; and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. To determine the fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates, judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows the reporting unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis; the discount rate used as a part of the discounted cash flow analysis; future economic and market conditions; and market comparables of peer companies, among others. If, as per the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting",10,"['Finite lived intangible assets, useful life']",us-gaap_FiniteLivedIntangibleAssetUsefulLife,durationItemType,orcl,"Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years.",one to 10 years,DATE,"Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years.","['Intangible assets', 'indefinite useful life', 'useful lives']","['Intangible assets', 0.5700002908706665, 'What is one to 10 years ?', 'Intangible assets']",Intangible assets,0.5700002908706665,What is one to 10 years ?,Intangible assets,Intangible assets useful life

22,"Stock Based Compensation We account for share based payments to employees, including grants of service based restricted stock unit awards, performance based restricted stock unit awards (PSUs), service based employee stock options, performance based stock options (PSOs), and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which requires that share based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We account for forfeitures of stock based awards as they occur. For our service based stock awards, we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years. For our PSUs and PSOs, we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the longer of the derived, explicit or implicit service period (which is the period of time expected for the performance condition to be satisfied). During our interim and annual reporting periods, stock based compensation expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets that result in a change in the number of shares that are expected to vest, or changes in our estimates of implicit service periods, may cause the amount of stock based compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation of the number of shares that are expected to vest are reflected in the amount of stock based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU or PSO tranche on a cumulative catch up basis during each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered. Changes in estimates of the implicit service periods are recognized prospectively.
