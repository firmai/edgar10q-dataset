2,"Cash Equivalents and Investments: Investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. The Company also invests in certain mutual funds, which include equity and fixed income securities, related to its obligations under its deferred compensation plan, and such investments are classified as trading securities on the consolidated balance sheets. All of the Company's other investments are classified as available for sale at the respective balance sheet dates. The Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities are recognized as ""Other income (expense)"" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The investments classified as available for sale are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices, and difference between the cost and fair value of available for sale securities is presented as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized losses on available for sale securities are charged against other income (expense) when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. The Company considers several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary. These factors include but are not limited to (1) the extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis, (2) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (3) the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position, and (4) the Company's ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The Company's ongoing consideration of these factors could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect its results of operation. An other than temporary impairment is triggered when there is an intent to sell the security, it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold before recovery, or the security is not expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Other than temporary impairments attributed to credit losses are recognized in the income statement. The specific identification method is used to determine the realized gains and losses on investments. The Company recorded a $42.5 million other than temporary impairment charge during the year ended June 24, 2018. No other than temporary impairment charges were recognized during the years ended June 28, 2020 or June 30, 2019.",42.5,"['Impairment of investments', 'Other than temporary impairment charge']",us-gaap_OtherThanTemporaryImpairmentLossesInvestmentsPortionRecognizedInEarningsNet,monetaryItemType,lrcx,"The Company recorded a $42.5 million other than temporary impairment charge during the year ended June 24, 2018.",$42.5 million,MONEY,"The Company recorded a $42.5 million other than temporary impairment charge during the year ended June 24, 2018.",['impairment charge'],"['temporary impairment charge', 0.8913781642913818, 'What is $42.5 million ?', 'temporary impairment charge']",temporary impairment charge,0.8913781642913818,What is $42.5 million ?,temporary impairment charge,Other than temporary impairment charge
